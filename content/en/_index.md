## Key Research Behind Healthspan

**Up to 70%** of longevity is determined by lifestyle and behavior. Genetics matter less than most people think.

**6 hours** is the typical minimum sleep for cognitive and physical health. More improves results.

**Meditation** increases attention span, reduces stress, and improves emotional regulation. Effects measurable in weeks.

**Movement** for 30 minutes most days adds years to life and improves quality. Walking counts.

**Social connection** is as important to longevity as exercise. Isolation increases early death risk.

**Purpose** matters. People with clear meaning live longer and healthier.

## Common Questions

**Do I have to do everything at once?**

No. Pick one area. Master it. Add more when you're ready. Most people start with sleep or movement.

**How long until I see results?**

Sleep and focus can shift in days. Physical changes take weeks. Deep consciousness work takes months. Start small and notice.

**What if I have health conditions?**

Our guides include safety notes. Talk to your doctor before changing anything major. We support medical care, not replace it.

**Is this expensive?**

No. Core content is free. We offer optional advanced guides and coaching. You decide what's right for you.

**Can I do this alone?**

Yes. Many people start alone and find community later. We have both options.

**What about my personality type?**

Healthspan works for everyone. Introverts and extroverts. Detailed planners and intuitive types. Skeptics and explorers. We meet you where you are.

**How is this different from other wellness sites?**

We focus on what's proven. We avoid trends. We write for clarity. We build for accessibility. We respect your time and intelligence.
